## infra
### Project Overview:
Create a cloud-native application that runs on Kubernetes in AWS, with infrastructure provisioned through Terraform and configured via Ansible. The application's lifecycle will be managed through a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline, and its operations will be monitored using the ELK stack.

### Step 1: Set Up the AWS Environment
AWS Account: AWS Free Tier
IAM User: Create an IAM user with programmatic access and adequate permissions for managing EC2 instances, EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service), and other required services.

### Step 2: Define Infrastructure with Terraform
Install Terraform: Download and install Terraform on local machine.
Terraform Scripts: Write Terraform scripts to provision:
VPC, subnets, and other networking resources.
An EKS cluster to run Kubernetes application.
Any other AWS resources needed by application (e.g., RDS for databases, S3 for storage).

### Step 3: Configure Infrastructure with Ansible
Install Ansible:  Ansible is installed on local machine or a control node.
Ansible Playbooks: Write Ansible playbooks to configure:
EC2 instances for Jenkins, ELK stack, or other services not managed by Kubernetes.
Any specific configurations needed within the Kubernetes cluster once it's provisioned by Terraform.

### Step 4: Set Up CI/CD with Jenkins
Jenkins Setup: Use an EC2 instance or manage Jenkins in Kubernetes as a pod.
Pipeline Configuration: Configure Jenkins pipelines for:
Continuous Integration: Code build, unit tests, and integration tests.
Continuous Deployment: Automated deployment of the application to the Kubernetes cluster upon successful build and tests.

### Step 5: Containerize Application
Docker: Containerize application by writing a Dockerfile and building a Docker image.
Kubernetes Deployment: Write Kubernetes deployment and service YAML files to define how application should be deployed and exposed within the cluster.

### Step 6: Implement Monitoring with the ELK Stack
ELK Deployment: Deploy Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana either on EC2 instances or within Kubernetes (as separate pods or using a managed service like Amazon Elasticsearch Service).
Log Collection: Configure Logstash or Filebeat to collect logs from your application and other services, and send them to Elasticsearch.
Dashboards: Use Kibana to create dashboards for visualizing logs and monitoring application performance.

### Step 7: Test, Iterate, and Document
Testing: Test the entire workflow from code commit, CI/CD pipeline, to deployment in Kubernetes, and monitoring.
Iteration: Refine configurations, scripts, and pipelines based on test outcomes.
Documentation: Document setup, configurations, and any important findings or decisions made during the project.
This project will give a hands-on experience with a wide range of DevOps tools and practices. The key to learning is experimentation.
